# ReplAwake
Keep your repls from falling asleep with a fork and a single line of code.

## How to Get Started
Click [here](https://replit.com/github/yodalightsabr/replawake) to fork the GitHub repo into your account. Head over to the `.replconfig` file and follow the instructions there to add repls.

## How It Works
ReplAwake will ping every repl you would like to keep awake. It contacts an external server which pings your ReplAwake instance to keep itself awake.

You can see it in action at [https://replawake.yodacode.repl.co](https://replawake.yodacode.repl.co).
